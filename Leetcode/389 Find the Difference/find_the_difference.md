# 389. Find the Difference

## Problem Statement

> You are given two strings s and t.
> String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
> Return the letter that was added to t.
>
> Constraints:
>
> - 0 <= s.length <= 1000
> - t.length == s.length + 1
> - s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Examples

Example 1:

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

## Sorting Solution

- Time: O(nlog(n)), where n => length of s/t
- Space: O(1)

```
* Sort both string in-place
* Iterate character at a time and check if there is a mismatch
```

## Hash Map Solution

- Time: O(n), where n => length of s/t
- Space: O(1) -> since it is guaranteed that all the characters in s and t are lowercase letters

```
Input:
s = 'abcd'
t = 'aabcd'

count_s = {
    a: 1
    b: 1
    c: 1
    d: 1
}

count_t = {
    a: 2     * count mismatch => return a
    b: 1
    c: 1
    d: 1
}

Output: 'a'

```

```
Input:
s = 'abcd'
t = 'abfcd'

count_s = {
    a: 1
    b: 1
    c: 1
    d: 1
}

count_t = {
    a: 1
    b: 1
    c: 1
    d: 1
    f: 1    * character not found in count_s => return 'f'
}

Output: 'a'

```

## Bit Manipulation Solution

```
* This solution uses the fact that `t` is made up of characters from `s`
* This implies that all characters in `s` have a twin in `t` except for one
* XOR of all characters in (s + t) will return the extra character

0 ^ 0 = 0
0 ^ 1 = 1
1 ^ 0 = 1
1 ^ 1 = 0

```
