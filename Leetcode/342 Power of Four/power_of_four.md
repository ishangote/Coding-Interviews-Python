## Problem Statement

> Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of four. Otherwise, return false. An integer n is a power of four, if there exists an integer x such that n == 4<sup>x</sup>.
> Follow up: Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

> Constraints:
>
> - -2<sup>31</sup> <= n <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

## Examples

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 16
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 5
Output: false
```

Example 3:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
```
