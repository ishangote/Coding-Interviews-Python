# You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. 
# These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.
# Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.
"""
Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:
The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:

        1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 4 -- 5 -- 6 -- None
                  |
                  7 -- 8 -- 9 -- 10 -- None
                       |
                       11 -- 12 -- None

ans = 1 -- 2 -- 3 -- 7 -- 8 -- 11 -- 12

stack = [-- 4--5--6, -- 9--10]
