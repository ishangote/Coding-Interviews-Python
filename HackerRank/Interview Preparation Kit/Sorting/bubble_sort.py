Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
        }
    }
    
}
Given an array of integers, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following three lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps. where  is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement, where is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement, where is the last element in the sorted array.
